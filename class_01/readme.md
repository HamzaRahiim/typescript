# a. presentation

# b. Instalation steps For typescript:
vs code ( place for coding also known as IDE )
node.js ( for running javascript code outside the browser so we need node.js )
verify the installation through running the command ( node --version ) if it shows the version then it is successfully installed.
With the installation of node.js it provide the access of using npm (node package manager), also check npm version by running command ( npm --version )
Installing typescript run this command ( npm i -g typescript ) 
verify the installation of typescript by running this command ( tsc --version )

# c. Running our first typeScript Code:
folder open in vs code 
create a file name class.ts ( .ts extension )
add this code in a class.ts file = console.log("hellow world")

# d. running code: 
Open the terminal ( click the button ctrl + j to open terminal )
tsc class.ts ( code convert js file )
node class.js ( run js file )

Important Note :
for checking node and typescript version you can use different methods like :
1. Open VS code then Open terminal in VS code and in the terminal run the version checking commmand.
2. Open Command Prompt from window directly ( search cmd in window taskbar, and open command prompt ) Now in command prompt you can check the version of node and typescript to verify its installation.
