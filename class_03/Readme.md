### 1. Case Sensitive:

Variables names are case sensitive, let understand with the following examples:

```jsx
let country = “Pakistan”
let Country = “Dubai”
```

Here this both Variables are considering different variables, this is what variables names are case sensitive.

### 3. Arithmetic's Operators:

### 8. Operators:

Here we are going to start some of the operators of JavaScript, first let understand the plus operator role between string and other data type values.

```jsx
let sum = "Hamza " + 5 // output will be "Hamza 5"
let bool = "State " + true // output will "State true"
let empty = "done " + null // output will be "done null" 
let combine = "Welcome " + "TypeScript" // output will be "Welcome TypeScript"
```

From the above examples it is clear that when we add any data type values like number, Boolean etc. with string value it converts it into string value.
