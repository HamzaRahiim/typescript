## Assignment no 1:

### Problem 1:

- Create a TypeScript program that declares a single variable to store the age of a user. The program should then use an if-else statement to check whether the user's age is greater than 18. If the condition is true, the program should output a message saying "You are allowed for driving." If the condition is false, it should output "You are not allowed for driving."

### Problem 2:

- Create a TypeScript program that declares two variables: one for storing the username and another for storing the password. Use an if-else block to check the input username and password against predefined values using logical operators. If both the username and password match the predefined values, output "You are logged in." Otherwise, output "You are not authorized."
