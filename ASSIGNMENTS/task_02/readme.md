## Assignment no 2:

### Problem 1:

**Creating a Simple Greeting Function in TypeScript**

- Write a TypeScript function named greet that takes one parameter, name, which should be of type string. The function should return a greeting in the form of a string, "Hello, [name]!", where [name] is the value passed to the function. For example, if the input is "Alice", the function should return "Hello, Alice!". This task will help you practice defining functions with typed parameters and returning a string value.

### Problem 2:

**Enhancing the Greeting Function with Optional Parameters**

- Develop a TypeScript function named personalizedGreet that takes two parameters: name (type string) and timeOfDay (type string, optional). The function should return a personalized greeting based on the time of day. If timeOfDay is provided, the function should return "Good [timeOfDay], [name]!", otherwise, it should default to "Hello, [name]!". For example, calling personalizedGreet("Alice", "Morning") should return "Good Morning, Alice!", and calling personalizedGreet("Bob") should return "Hello, Bob!".
